{"name":"Npsgate","tagline":"NpsGate SmartNet","body":"#NpsGate\r\n=======\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n------------\r\nNpsGate is an implementation of the SmartNet architecture designed in the master's\r\nthesis by Lance Alt titled \"Application Transparent HTTP over a Disruption Tolerant\r\nSmartNet\". The SmartNet architecture is a modular framework for experimenting with\r\nand deploying network adaptation solutions.\r\n\r\nNpsGate implements the SmartNet core along with several plugins that can be arranged\r\nto form packet processing piplines. A plugin API is provided to easily allow third-\r\nparty plugins to be incorporated in to the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n------------\r\nTo compile the NpsGate core from the git repository you need the following tools and\r\nlibraries:\r\n\r\n  - autoconf / automake / libtool\r\n  - A C++ compiler (only GCC has been tested)\r\n  - Boost C++ libraries (specifically system and threads libraries)\r\n  - libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig)\r\n  - libcrafter (http://code.google.com/p/libcrafter)\r\n  - libnetfilterqueue-dev (http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/)\r\n\r\nSpecific plugins may have additional requirements. Once the above library prerequisites\r\nhave been met, NpsGate can be compiled as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ ./autogen.sh\r\n    $ ./configure\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\nBy default NpsGate is installed in the 'run' directory. The installation directory can\r\nbe changed using the 'configure' script.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\n-------------\r\nNpsGate requires a configuration file to run. A simple default configuration is installed\r\nin the 'run' directory. More examples can be found in the 'doc/configuration/examples' directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Running\r\n-------\r\nNpsGate can be run using the default configuration using the following command from the\r\nrun directory:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo ./npsgate\r\n\r\nNpsGate can be started with a specific configuration using the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo ./npsgate -c /path/to/main/configuration/file\r\n\r\nNpsGate typically must be run as root in order to intercept packets from the kernel.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
